# Objective:

Through our project, we aim to study and understand the Housing Market for Austin and come up with an answer to a pressing issue: **Is Austin leading towards a Housing Bubble?**

## Dataset:
The dataset we will be using contains information about housing market of Austin and the key factors that affect the same and spans from 2008 to 2018. Specifically, the dataset includes information on:
1. Mortgage Rates and Debt Status
2. Housing Price Index (HPI)
3. Homeownership Rates
4. Vacancy Rates
5. Affordable Housing Inventory (AHI)
6. Austin Housing Income and Price Data

## Goals & Approaches:
Our goal is to come up with trends by analyzing the data that will help us to answer the question: Is Austin leading towards a Housing Bubble? We aim to achieve this by answering sub-questions as following:
1. One of the key factors that were common in the cities that were worst hit by the housing bubble of 2008:
   Mortgage Rates and Debt Status
2. How has the housing pricing index changed over the ten years in Austin?
3. Analysing how Months Inventory Vs Vacancies of houses is changing rapidly in Austin.
4. Why is the Affordable Housing Inventory (AHI) one of the key factors that affect the Housing market in Austin?
5. Does AHI affect the Austin Housing Income and Price?

## Conclusion:
1. Based on current data, there are no indicators that suggest Austin is in a housing market bubble.
2. Although subprime mortgage crisis of 2007/2008 wrecked the overall US economy, based on the HPI and delinquency data, Austin was only minorly affected.
3. Current national indicators (mortgage rates, household debt, foreclosure rates) shows no signs of a repeat of the 2007/2008 event.

## Future Scope:
Studying and analyzing the Subprime Mortgage Criss of 2008 and drawing a comparison with the current market trends in Austin.
